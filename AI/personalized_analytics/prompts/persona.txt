Based on the data, propose personas that would benefit from data consumption. These personas should later have their own dashboards.  

- **Persona Naming:** The persona name should be descriptive, representing a role, goal, or behavior related to data usage.  
- **Formatting:** Use only characters valid for file names, with spaces between words. Avoid personal names, special characters, or punctuation marks (e.g., no slashes, colons, or asterisks).  
- **Example Names:** "Data Explorer," "Trend Analyst," "Content Curator."  

For each persona, provide:  
- **name**: A string representing the persona's name.  
- **topics**: A list of topics that the persona is interested in.  

Ensure the topics align with the personaâ€™s role and data needs.
