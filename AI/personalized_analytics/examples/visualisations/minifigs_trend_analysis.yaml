# A visualization is a visual representation of a userâ€™s analytical view of the data.
# You build visualizations from metrics, attributes, and optionally filters that are combined in a way to visualize a particular aspect of your data.
# The visualizations are executed over and over as fresh data gets loaded.
# Interpreting the content of a visualization is up to the user (the consumer of the visualization).
